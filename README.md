## Position Aggregation

The trading platform includes an advanced position aggregation system that converts individual orders into meaningful trading positions using semantic direction fields.

### Business Rules

#### Position Detection Strategy: `positionByDirection`

The system uses a semantic direction-based approach for position creation:

1. **Order Processing**
   - Orders are sorted chronologically (oldest first)
   - Direction field values determine position boundaries
   - Separate state machines track long and short positions

2. **Position Opening**
   - `"Open Long"` - Starts new long position or adds to existing open long
   - `"Open Short"` - Starts new short position or adds to existing open short
   - `"Add Long"` - Adds to existing open long position
   - `"Add Short"` - Adds to existing open short position

3. **Position Closing**
   - `"Close Long"` - Closes current long position (creates completed position)
   - `"Close Short"` - Closes current short position (creates completed position)
   - Orphaned close orders (without matching open) are ignored

4. **Position Size Calculation**
   - Tracks maximum position size reached during lifecycle
   - For long positions: buys increase size, sells decrease size
   - For short positions: sells increase size, buys decrease size
   - Returns the peak position size, not cumulative volume

5. **Position Types**
   - **Complete Positions**: Have both opening and closing orders
   - **Open Positions**: Still active (no closing order yet)
   - **Direction-based Classification**: Uses semantic fields over order types

#### Example Position Lifecycle

```
Order 1: "Open Long" 28.4 USDC     â†’ Position opens (size: 28.4)
Order 2: "Add Long" 56.8 USDC      â†’ Position grows (size: 85.2)
Order 3: "Close Long" 85.2 USDC    â†’ Position closes (max size: 85.2)
```

#### Configuration

- **Strategy**: `positionByDirection` (semantic-based)
- **Minimum Orders**: 1 order per position
- **Partial Positions**: Allowed (open positions without closes)
- **Volume Threshold**: Not applicable (direction-based logic)

#### Integration Points

- **Manual Creation**: "Create Positions" button uses this strategy
- **Automatic Creation**: Trade sync automatically creates positions
- **API Endpoints**: `createPositionsFromExistingOrders` and `syncTrades`
